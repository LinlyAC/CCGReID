# CCGReID Datasets
Cloth-changing group re-identification dataset, incluidng **GroupPRCC** and **GroupVC** datasets.

## Introduction
* GroupPRCC dataset contains 7,514 training images of 64 group identities and 3,676 testing images of 32 group identities, which are captured under 3 cameras.
* GroupVC dataset contains 3,832 training images of 111 group identities and 4,179 testing images of 118 group identities, which are captured under 4 cameras.
* Both datasets provide SCS (same-cloth setting) and CCS (cross-cloth setting) protocols, corrsponding x_SCS.txt and x_CCS.txt, where x $\in${query,gallery}.

Please note: For ease of storage and distribution, we store the member (size: $256\times128$) in each group in a single, uniform-sized image (size: $256\times768$) with proper zero padding. The image of each member can be easily obtained by dividing the group image in six equal parts and discarding obvious zero padding.

## Annotation
The annotation in both datasets have the same format:
```
Img_Path Group_ID,Camera_ID Num_Of_Total_Member,Num_Of_CC_Member ClothID_Of_CC_Member
```
For example, label ` ./train/0_1_2.jpg 0,1 5,2 1,1 ` means the group id and canera id of image (./train/0_1_2.jpg) is 0 and 1. This image contains 5 members and there are 2 cloth-changing members within them. (Optionally, the cloth id of current cloth-changing members are also provided, as 1 and 1, respectively.)
